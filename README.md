# Selgen
Project was created by Michal Polak and Jan Humplik, as employees of **Center of the Region Hana of Palacky University in Olomouc** for **Selgen** company. Purpose of project code is evaluation of **Selgen** experimental data. Data have form of RGB images. Camera monitors trays with plant, these trays are analyzed objects (ROI). In experiments plant recovery after stress exposion is evaluated.
## Platform
Project is developed only in **Python 3** programming language. At this moment I expect that analysis will be executed on server with *Windows10* OS. So at this moments all instructions stand for *Windows10* OS.
## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Project is not prepared for deployment in live system.
